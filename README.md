# Pewlett Hackard SQL Challenge
----
In this Challenge, I create a database of over 300,000 employees from six employee data files and run eight queries as part of a research project concerning people employed by this company during the 1980s and 1990s.  Within this repository, you will find images of query results and the database's Entity Relationship Diagram in the Images folder, the six CSV files in the Resources folder, and the SQL scripts in the EmployeeSQL folder.
