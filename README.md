# Pewlett Hackard Homicide Investigation
----
On December 28, 2016, at 10:35 PM, a janitor, Mr. Ulf Flexer, while looking for extra cleaning supplies, discovered an overlooked utility closet in the basement of a building at 457 E. Gladwell Ave belonging to his employer, Pewlett Hackard.  Because the utility closet was both sealed and locked, Mr. Flexer called his supervisor, Mr. Herb Swiler, to report the situation.  During the phone call, Mr. Swiler told Mr. Flexer that he was unaware of the existence of the utility closet, which was unusual, and gave Mr. Flexer permission to break open the door.  Upon doing so, Mr. Flexer discovered a completely decomposed corpse and immediately called police.  Police investigators and a forensics team cordoned off the scene, collected the evidence, and sent the body the Office of the Medical Examiner.  

From the findings and the initial Missing and Unidentified Persons Report, these investigators established the existing narrative surrounding the homicide.  The body belongs to a woman, Ms. Magdalena Krider, last seen on December 18, 1996, leaving an awards dinner four blocks away at the company’s headquarters with an unidentified man.  Ms. Krider was 32 years old and had worked at Pewlett Hackard for 10 years; at the time, she had recently been promoted to Technique Leader in the Development Department.  The purpose of the dinner was to thank those employees who had been at the company for ten years and distinguished themselves in some way.  As such, Ms. Krider was one of thousands of employees to receive an engraved gold and crystal obelisk award at the event.  Ironically, Ms. Krider was bludgeoned to death with just such an object although her award found next to her was not the murder weapon.  What’s more, in addition to some personal items, investigators found a letter in her purse from another award recipient that night, Hercules B., expressing amorous feelings for Ms. Krider.  Investigators believe she was murdered in the building and then moved to the utility closet but are not sure how she gained access to the building: only the company’s department managers had after-hours access and only to buildings housing their departments; at the time of her death, the building was home to the Sales and Development Departments.
