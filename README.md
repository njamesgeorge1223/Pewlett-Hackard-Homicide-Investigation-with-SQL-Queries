# Pewlett Hackard Homicide Investigation
----
On December 28, 2016, at 10:35 PM, a janitor, Mr. Ulf Flexer, while looking for extra cleaning supplies, discovered an overlooked utility closet in the basement of an office building at 457 E. Gladwell Ave belonging to his employer, Pewlett Hackard.  Because the utility closet was locked, Mr. Flexer called his supervisor, Mr. Herb Swiler, to report the situation.  During the phone call, Mr. Swiler told Mr. Flexer that he was unaware of the existence of the utility closet, which was unusual, and gave Mr. Flexer permission to break the lock and gain access to the room.  After doing so, Mr. Flexer discovered a completely decomposed corpse and immediately contacted police.  Police investigators cordoned off the scene, collected the evidence, and sent the body the Office of the Medical Examiner.  

From the findings and the initial Missing and Unidentified Persons Report, these investigators established the existing narrative surrounding the homicide.  The body belongs to a woman, Ms. Magdalena Krider, last seen with an unidentified man on December 18, 1996, leaving an awards dinner four blocks away at the company’s headquarters.  Ms. Krider was 32 years old and had worked at Pewlett Hackard for 10 years; at the time, she recently had been promoted to Technique Leader in the Development Department.  This event was the company’s way of thanking those employees who had been at the company for ten years and distinguished themselves in some way.  As such, Ms. Krider was one of thousands of employees to receive an engraved gold and crystal obelisk award.  Ironically, Ms. Krider was bludgeoned to death with just such an object although her award, found next to her, was not the murder weapon.  What’s more, in addition to some personal items, investigators found a letter in her purse from another award recipient that night, Hercules B., expressing amorous feelings for Ms. Krider.  Investigators believe she was murdered somewhere nearby and then moved to the utility closet but are not sure how she gained access to the building: only the company’s department managers had after-hours access and alarm system codes but only to buildings housing their departments; on the night of the murder, the building, home to the Sales and Development Departments, had no signs of break-in and no alarm events.

Due to inquiries from the victim’s family concerning progress, my supervisor asked me to create a suspect list from the only company information available from that period: a legacy employee database in the form of six CSV files.  Upon receiving the files, I studied their structure and visualized my database design in the form of an entity-relationship diagram.
