# Pewlett Hackard SQL Challenge
----
In this Challenge, I create a database of over 300,000 employees from six csv files and run eight queries as part of a research project concerning people employed by this company during the 1980s and 1990s.  Within this repository, you will find images of query results and the Entity Relationship Diagram for the database in the Images folder, the six employee data files in the Resources folder, and the SQL scripts for database creation and querying in the EmployeeSQL folder.
