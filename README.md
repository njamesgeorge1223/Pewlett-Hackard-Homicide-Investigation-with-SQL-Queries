# Pewlett Hackard Homicide Investigation
----
On December 28, 2016, at 10:35 PM, a janitor, Mr. Ulf Flexer, while looking for extra cleaning supplies, came across an overlooked utility closet in the basement of an office building at 457 E. Gladwell Ave belonging to his employer, Pewlett Hackard.  Because the utility closet was locked, Mr. Flexer called his supervisor, Mr. Herb Swiler, to report the situation.  During the phone call, Mr. Swiler told Mr. Flexer that he was unaware of the existence of the utility closet, an unusual occurrence, and gave Mr. Flexer permission to break the lock and gain access to the room.  After doing so, Mr. Flexer discovered a completely decomposed corpse and immediately contacted police.  Within the next few hours, police investigators cordoned off the scene, carefully photographed, collected, and catalogued the evidence, and sent the body to the Office of the Medical Examiner.

From the findings and the initial Missing and Unidentified Persons Report, these investigators established the narrative surrounding the homicide.  The body belongs to a woman, Ms. Magdalena Krider, last seen with an unidentified man at about 10:00 PM on December 18, 1996, leaving an awards dinner four blocks from the scene of the crime at Pewlett Hackard’s headquarters.  Ms. Krider was 32 years old and had worked at Pewlett Hackard for 10 years; at the time, she recently had been promoted to Technique Leader in the Development Department.  This event was the company’s way of thanking those employees who had been at the company for ten years and distinguished themselves in some way.  As such, Ms. Krider was one of thousands of employees to receive an engraved gold and crystal obelisk award.  Ironically, Ms. Krider was bludgeoned to death with just such an object although her award, found among her possessions, was not the murder weapon.  What’s more, investigators found a letter in her purse from another award recipient that night, Hercules B., expressing amorous feelings for Ms. Krider.  Investigators believe she was murdered somewhere nearby and then moved to the utility closet but are not sure how she gained access to the building: only the company’s department managers had after-hours access and alarm system codes but only to buildings housing their departments; on the night of the murder, the building, home to the Sales and Development Departments, had no signs of break-in and no alarm events.

To produce some leads for the case, my supervisor asked me to create a suspect list from the only company information available from that period: a legacy employee database in the form of six CSV files.  Upon receiving the files, I study their structure and design a series of database tables. To implement my design in a Postgres Database, I execute my SQL script, CreateTableSchemata.sql, with the Postgres Administrative Tool, pgAdmin4; to upload the CSV files into the database, I again use pgAdmin4.

To ensure data integrity and conceptualize the data set, I run the queries in my SQL script, DataIntegrityQueries.sql.  From the results, I conclude that the data in the various tables are consistent with each other and reveal the following facts about Pewlett Hackard from 1985 to 2000:

•	The company has 300,024 employees.

•	The company’s gender distribution is 60% men and 40% women.

•	The company has nine departments run by 24 managers: Marketing, Finance, Human Resources, Production, Development, Quality Management, Sales, Research, and Customer Service.

•	Although the company maintains nine separate departments, 10.5% of the employees belong to two departments and 89.5% belong to one department; managers only belong to and manage one department.

•	Each employee has only one of seven possible job titles: Staff, Senior Staff, Assistant Engineer, Engineer, Senior Engineer, Technique Leader, and Manager.

•	The most common job title is Staff and the least common is Manager.

•	While many employees share common first or last names, the percent of employees with a distinct first and last name is 93.1%.

To derive a short list of suspects I start with broad queries and work my way down to narrow ones.  This is the list of my initial five questions to the Postgres Database and the results.

1.1	Who are the Department Managers who have access to buildings after hours as well as alarm codes?

1.2 Who are the employees hired in 1986?

1.3 Who are the employees with the first name, Hercules, and a last name starting with the letter, B?

1.4 Who are the employees in the Sales Department?

1.5 Who are the employees in the Sales and Development Departments?

Although accurately incorporating case details, the initial queries produced too many hits, so I combine criteria to reduce the number of possible suspects.

2.1 Who are the employees with a first name, Hercules, and a last name starting with the letter, B, whom the company hired in 1986?
<img width="1154" alt="HomicideInvestigationSuspectsQuery1" src="https://github.com/njgeorge000158/Homicide-Investigation-with-SQL-Queries/assets/137228821/5c7f972f-5436-4053-9714-d31c94d32ca3">

2.2 Which employees were Department Managers in Sales or Development?
<img width="1065" alt="HomicideInvestigationSuspectsQuery2" src="https://github.com/njgeorge000158/Homicide-Investigation-with-SQL-Queries/assets/137228821/379863bc-bece-46be-8bf7-b7a7ca44a98e">

2.3 Which employees were men, hired in 1986, and were Department Managers in Sales or Development?
<img width="1066" alt="HomicideInvestigationSuspectsQuery3" src="https://github.com/njgeorge000158/Homicide-Investigation-with-SQL-Queries/assets/137228821/0f840108-fb47-412b-92d1-a465adb2ed36">

From this analysis, I have two suspects for my supervisor: Hercules Benzmuller, an engineer in the Production Department; and Hauke Zhang, a manager in the Sales Department. 

In conclusion, the perpetrator was arrested for the murder of Magdalena Krider.  When investigators walked into Mr. Zhang's office to question him about the murder, they immediately noticed the damaged gold and crystal obelisk award in a bookcase (next to a picture of his wife): he had kept it in plain view since the murder and confessed upon being confronted with the evidence.  The married Mr. Zhang had a quid pro quo relationship with the victim that led, at the time of the murder, to her recent promotion and subsequent death.  On the night of the awards event, the pair walked back to the building where Mr. Zhang opened the doors, deactivated the alarm system, and entered the empty building with the expectation of a romantic liaison with Ms. Krider.  When she resisted his overtures and announced that the more intimate aspects of their arrangement were over, Mr. Zhang killed Ms. Krider in a fit of rage.  Mr. Zhang then hid the body in the basement utility closet before cleaning up, turning on the alarm system, locking the doors, and going home to his family. By virtue of his socioeconomic status, his and the victim's discretion concerning their relationship, and the apparent lack of any evidence connecting the pair beyond working in the same building for a mutual employer, he was not a suspect when she went missing or was found dead.  Although speculation, I believe Mr. Zhang kept the evidence in plain sight to remind him of the inevitable: an hourglass with sand endlessly running from the top to the bottom bulb until those investigators walked through his office door.  Ultimately, if this situation teaches us anything, it's that love can be a funny thing and make us act out of character, but obsession is not love.  With obsession, our acts are not funny at all and can lead to tragic consequences. Mr. Zhang was living on borrowed time, a little over twenty years to be exact, but it was twenty years more than Ms. Krider had.
